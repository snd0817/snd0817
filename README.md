üëã Hello, I'm Sandhya Thakur!
I'm a passionate Python developer with a strong focus on building scalable applications and leveraging AI/ML technologies. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle, from designing and implementing robust backend systems to creating intuitive front-end interfaces. I enjoy tackling complex challenges in natural language processing and optimization, with a particular interest in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

üî≠ My Work
My portfolio showcases a blend of research-driven projects, full-stack application development, and foundational computer science concepts.

Language Perfecter: A full-stack NLP tool for grammar and text enhancement. This project demonstrates my ability to build a complete application from scratch, utilizing FastAPI for the backend and React for a responsive user interface, all containerized with Docker.

Neural Date Translation: I developed and optimized an Encoder-Decoder model for date format translation. By incorporating an attention mechanism, I significantly improved accuracy to over 98%, showcasing my deep understanding of deep learning architectures.

Algorithm Visualization: This project provides an interactive web tool, built with React and JavaScript, to visualize core algorithms with animations and step-through controls. It's designed to improve the understanding of data structures and algorithm flow.

sentence_correcto: A project focused on sentence correction, which complements my work in NLP and text enhancement.

bayes-theorem: A repository exploring the implementation and principles of Bayes' Theorem, a core concept in probability and machine learning.

acessibility_analyzer: A project focused on analyzing web accessibility, demonstrating my commitment to building inclusive and user-friendly web applications.

image-text-converter: A tool for converting images to text, showcasing my skills in image processing and computer vision.
